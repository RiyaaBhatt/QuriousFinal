            <h2>What is RAI?</h2>
            <p>RAI (Reasoning About Information) refers to the ability of AI systems to explain their reasoning and decision-making processes. Unlike traditional AI models that often operate as black boxes, RAI systems strive to be transparent and accountable. This transparency allows humans to understand how AI systems arrive at their conclusions, fostering trust and enabling informed decision-making.</p>

            <h2>How Does RAI Work?</h2>
            <p>There are various approaches to implementing RAI, including:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">Explainable AI (XAI) techniques: These techniques aim to make AI models interpretable by humans, often through visualizations or textual explanations.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Counterfactual reasoning: This approach involves analyzing how different input scenarios might have influenced the AI's decision, providing insights into its reasoning process.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Causal inference: This technique helps establish causal relationships between data points, allowing for a deeper understanding of the factors influencing the AI's output.</li>
